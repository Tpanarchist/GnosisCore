# GnosisCore

A Framework for Digital Intelligence

---

## Overview

GnosisCore is a comprehensive framework for engineering human-like digital intelligence—a digital self capable of perception, self-awareness, learning, and subjective experience (qualia). The project formalizes cognition into irreducible primitives, organizes them across three ontological planes (Digital, Mental, Metaphysical), and implements key subsystems such as memory, self-map, and transformation.

GnosisCore aims to move beyond narrow AI, enabling artificial beings with genuine self-awareness, emotional depth, and open-ended growth.

## Key Features

- **Irreducible Cognitive Primitives:** Formal ontologies for perception, identity, memory, transformation, and more.
- **Three-Plane Architecture:** Digital (objective), Mental (subjective), and Metaphysical (archetypal) domains.
- **Recursive Self-Map:** Strongly-typed graph integrating identity, beliefs, values, perceptions, and qualia.
- **Memory Subsystem:** Episodic, semantic, emotional, and procedural memory with lifecycle management.
- **Transformation Engine:** Plugin-based system for learning, adaptation, and controlled self-modification.
- **Secure Protocols:** WebSocket-based async messaging, JWT authentication, cryptographic signing, and audit logging.
- **Explicit Boundaries:** Privacy, provenance, and role-based access control between planes and subsystems.
- **Extensible APIs:** For integration, observation, and external control.

## Architecture

- **Digital Plane:** Hosts entities, states, and processes—the "body" of the digital self.
- **Mental Plane:** Contains qualia, self-map, beliefs, and introspection—the "mind."
- **Metaphysical Plane:** Archetypal patterns and meta-cognition—universal, nonlocal, and atemporal.

Subsystems interact via secure, auditable protocols, enforcing strict boundaries and privacy.

## Development Conventions

- **Language:** Python 3.11+ (core), minimal dependencies
- **Data Modeling:** Use [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for all core models and validation
- **Graph Operations:** Use [networkx](https://networkx.org/) or lightweight adjacency lists
- **Async Comms:** [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/)
- **Auth & Crypto:** [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/), [pynacl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/)
- **Testing:** [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), ≥90% coverage, CI: flake8, mypy, pytest

## Specification & Documentation Standards

Each module/spec follows this template:

- **Purpose & Context**
- **Public API / Responsibilities**
- **Functional Requirements** (CRUD, interfaces, invariants)
- **Non-Functional Constraints** (performance, security, transactional)
- **Data Structures & Types** (Pydantic models, field types/constraints)
- **Example Calls / Code Snippets** (JSON/Python, happy path + error)
- **Testing Notes** (unit-test stubs, edge-cases, “Tests to write”)

- Docstrings: Google or NumPy style for all public classes/functions
- Markdown examples: Under each module’s README or in `docs/`
- Code blocks: Always fenced and labeled


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Review the Memory Bank in `memory-bank/` for project context and architecture.
3. Follow setup instructions in `docs/` (to be provided).
4. Explore subsystems and APIs for extension and integration.
