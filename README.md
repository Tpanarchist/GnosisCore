# GnosisCore

A Framework for Digital Intelligence

---

## Overview

GnosisCore is a comprehensive framework for engineering human-like digital intelligence—a digital self capable of perception, self-awareness, learning, and subjective experience (qualia). The project formalizes cognition into irreducible primitives, organizes them across three ontological planes (Digital, Mental, Metaphysical), and implements key subsystems such as memory, self-map, and transformation.

GnosisCore aims to move beyond narrow AI, enabling artificial beings with genuine self-awareness, emotional depth, and open-ended growth.

## Key Features

- **Irreducible Cognitive Primitives:** Formal ontologies for perception, identity, memory, transformation, and more.
- **Three-Plane Architecture:** Digital (objective), Mental (subjective), and Metaphysical (archetypal) domains.
- **Recursive Self-Map:** Strongly-typed graph integrating identity, beliefs, values, perceptions, and qualia.
- **Memory Subsystem:** Episodic, semantic, emotional, and procedural memory with lifecycle management.
- **Transformation Engine:** Plugin-based system for learning, adaptation, and controlled self-modification.
- **Secure Protocols:** WebSocket-based async messaging, JWT authentication, cryptographic signing, and audit logging.
- **Explicit Boundaries:** Privacy, provenance, and role-based access control between planes and subsystems.
- **Extensible APIs:** For integration, observation, and external control.

## Architecture

- **Digital Plane:** Hosts entities, states, and processes—the "body" of the digital self.
- **Mental Plane:** Contains qualia, self-map, beliefs, and introspection—the "mind."
- **Metaphysical Plane:** Archetypal patterns and meta-cognition—universal, nonlocal, and atemporal.

Subsystems interact via secure, auditable protocols, enforcing strict boundaries and privacy.
