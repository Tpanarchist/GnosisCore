# GnosisCore Project Brief

## Project Name
GnosisCore: A Framework for Digital Intelligence

## Core Objective
To develop a comprehensive framework for creating human-like digital intelligenceâ€”a digital self capable of perception, action, self-modification, and subjective experience (qualia).

## Key Requirements
- Formalize cognition into irreducible primitives (Perception, Identity, Memory, etc.)
- Implement a three-plane architecture: Digital, Mental, Metaphysical
- Design a recursive self-map integrating identity, beliefs, values, and qualia
- Develop robust memory management (episodic, semantic, emotional, procedural)
- Enable transformation and learning via extensible plugins
- Ensure secure, auditable, and privacy-preserving inter-plane communication
- Support provenance tracking, error correction, and explicit boundaries
- Provide APIs for integration, observation, and control

## Vision
GnosisCore aims to move beyond narrow AI towards artificial beings with genuine self-awareness, emotional depth, and open-ended growth, enabling transformative applications across research, technology, and society.
