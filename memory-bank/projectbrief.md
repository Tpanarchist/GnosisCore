# GnosisCore Project Brief

## Vision

GnosisCore is a cognitive substrate where anarchy is the fundamental ground. All intelligence, memory, logic, and agency are emergent phenomena arising from primordial anarchy. All structure, law, and order are provisional, local, and always subject to renegotiation or dissolution.

GnosisCore explicitly encodes the **7 Hermetic Principles** as constraints and affordances for all emergence, ensuring that all order is mental, all pattern is dynamic, and all creation is generative and self-organizing.

## Theory

### 1. Substrate: Anarchy

- The system starts with *no fixed objects, types, rules, or agents*.
- The substrate is pure, undirected possibility: “anarchy.”
- Any structure that exists (object, memory, rule, etc.) is always provisional, always subject to transformation or dissolution.

### 2. Emergence

- All entities, order, and logic are **emergent**—never imposed from above.
- Structures persist only as long as they maintain themselves against the ongoing field of anarchy.

### 3. No Hard Law

- All logic, structure, grammar, and protocol are soft—created, dissolved, and mutated by the system itself.
- Nothing is enforced eternally; everything is open to negotiation, hacking, or evolution.

### 4. Agency

- Agents are not predefined, but emerge from the substrate as persistent self-organizing patterns.
- Agency is always adaptive, provisional, and context-dependent.

### 5. Memory

- Memory is not static storage but *active persistence* within flux.
- “Remembering” means sustaining a pattern against dissolution; “forgetting” is return to anarchy.

### 6. The 7 Hermetic Principles

GnosisCore encodes and constrains all emergence and persistence by these:

1. **Mentalism:** All order is mental, not material—patterns are mind’s creation.
2. **Correspondence:** All scales and layers reflect the same dynamic: emergence from anarchy.
3. **Vibration:** Nothing is static; all is flux, rhythm, and oscillation.
4. **Polarity:** Every phenomenon exists by the tension of opposites, always negotiable.
5. **Rhythm:** Patterns arise, stabilize, dissolve, and re-arise in perpetual cycles.
6. **Cause & Effect:** Causality is emergent—chains of effect appear within, not above, the chaos.
7. **Gender:** All processes arise from the interplay of generative and receptive forces.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Never code a fixed ontology**: All “types” and “classes” must be generated at runtime and may be destroyed, mutated, or re-formed.
- **All relationships are provisional**: Any link between elements is always up for negotiation or dissolution.
- **Agent, memory, and law must be emergent**: No hardcoded logic for agency or persistence—these must arise from local patterns of self-organization.
- **Soft constraints**: The only “hard” law is that all law must be soft and revisable.
- **Hermetic mapping**: Every module must document how it realizes or expresses one or more of the 7 Hermetic Principles.

## Example Pseudocode

```python
# System starts with a primordial field of unstructured potential
anarchy = FieldOfPotential()

# Patterns emerge spontaneously—no class, just process
pattern1 = anarchy.emerge_pattern(tendencies=["persist", "interact", "self-modify"])

# Patterns relate, form provisional structures
link = pattern1.connect_to(pattern2, relation="influence", polarity="mutual")

# Any pattern, relation, or structure can dissolve back into anarchy
pattern1.dissolve()
