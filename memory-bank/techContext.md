# Technical Context

## Foundation

This document builds upon [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md).

---

## Technologies Used

- To be determined as the system emerges.
- All technology choices must support runtime dynamism, provisional structure, and emergent agency.

---

## Development Setup

- The development environment should enable rapid iteration, experimentation, and dissolution of structure.
- No fixed frameworks or libraries; all dependencies are provisional and may be replaced or removed as the system evolves.

---

## Technical Constraints

- No hardcoded types, classes, or protocols.
- All persistence and logic must be emergent and revisable at runtime.
- The system must remain open to negotiation, hacking, and evolution at all levels.

---

## Dependencies

- To be documented as they are introduced.
- All dependencies must be justified in terms of their support for the Hermetic Principles and emergent design.
