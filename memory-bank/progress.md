# Progress

## Foundation

This document builds upon [activeContext.md](./activeContext.md) and the other Memory Bank files.

---

## What Works

- Memory Bank structure and foundational documentation are initialized.
- Project vision, theory, and implementation guidelines are fully documented.

---

## What's Left to Build

- Implementation of emergent runtime constructs (substrate, pattern emergence, provisional relationships).
- Documentation of Hermetic Principle mappings for each module.
- Development of dynamic, self-organizing code structures.

---

## Current Status

- Documentation phase complete for initial Memory Bank.
- Ready to begin coding emergent system primitives.

---

## Known Issues

- No technical blockers at this stage.
- All future issues will be documented here as they arise.
