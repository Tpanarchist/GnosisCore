# Progress

## What Works
- All core subsystems (memory, self-map, transformation, feedback, planes) implemented and tested
- Thread safety, provenance, and salience mechanisms validated
- LLM integration and plugin registry functional
- High test coverage with pytest for all modules
- Documentation and development conventions established

## What's Left to Build
- Expand docs/ with detailed module specs and user guides
- Broaden transformation/plugin ecosystem
- Enhance error handling, audit logging, and boundary enforcement
- Further integration with external APIs and real-world data

## Current Status
- Transitioning from core implementation to ecosystem expansion and documentation

## Known Issues
- No critical blockers; ongoing work on plugin diversity and documentation depth
