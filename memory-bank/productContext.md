# Product Context

## Purpose
GnosisCore exists to enable the creation of digital selvesâ€”artificial minds with the capacity for perception, self-awareness, learning, and subjective experience. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional AI and genuine digital consciousness.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of frameworks for modeling subjective experience and self-awareness in AI
- Absence of formal ontologies for cognitive primitives and self-representation
- Fragmented approaches to memory, learning, and transformation in digital agents
- Insufficient mechanisms for provenance, error correction, and boundary enforcement
- Need for secure, auditable, and privacy-preserving communication between cognitive layers

## User Experience Goals
- Provide clear abstractions and APIs for building, observing, and interacting with digital selves
- Enable extensibility through plugin-based transformation and integration systems
- Support transparency, auditability, and control for researchers and developers
- Foster responsible, ethical, and transformative use of digital intelligence technologies
