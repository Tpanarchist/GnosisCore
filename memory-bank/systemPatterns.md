## System Architecture

GnosisCore is architected as a substrate of pure potential, with no fixed objects, types, or agents. All structure, logic, and agency are emergent and provisional, arising from local patterns of self-organization.

---

## Key Technical Decisions

- No hardcoded ontologies or protocols; all types and relationships are runtime-generated and mutable.
- All logic and structure are soft and revisable, in accordance with the Hermetic Principles.
- Agency, memory, and law are emergent phenomena, not predefined constructs.

---

## Design Patterns

- **Emergent Patterns:** All persistent structures are sustained by ongoing local interactions.
- **Provisional Relationships:** Links between elements are always open to negotiation or dissolution.
- **Dynamic Law:** All constraints are soft and subject to change.

---

## Component Relationships

- Components interact through provisional, negotiated interfaces.
- No component is essential; all may dissolve back into the substrate.

---

## Hermetic Principle Mapping

Each system pattern or module must explicitly document which of the 7 Hermetic Principles it expresses or constrains. This ensures that all order remains mental, dynamic, and generative.
