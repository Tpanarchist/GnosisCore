# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementation and refinement of all three planes (Digital, Mental, Metaphysical) and their subsystems (memory, self-map, transformation, feedback)
- Maintaining thread safety, provenance, and salience mechanisms
- Ensuring plugin-based extensibility and LLM integration
- Keeping test coverage high and aligned with evolving architecture

## Recent Changes
- All core subsystems implemented with Pydantic models and thread-safe registries
- DigitalPlane, MentalPlane, MetaphysicalPlane, and AsyncMetaphysicalPlane fully implemented
- Comprehensive pytest-based test suites for all primitives and subsystems
- README.md updated with architecture, conventions, and standards

## Next Steps
- Expand docs/ with module-level documentation and usage examples
- Integrate more transformation plugins and external APIs
- Continue improving test coverage and CI integration

## Coherence & Cohesion Improvement Plan

**Phase 1: Standardize Interfaces and Data Flow**
- Audit all subsystem interfaces (memory, selfmap, transformation, feedback, planes).
- Define a unified schema for events, primitives, and transformation payloads.
- Refactor method signatures for consistency (naming, parameters, return types).
- Document interface contracts and data flow diagrams in `docs/` and module-level docstrings.

**Phase 2: Centralize Documentation and API Contracts**
- For each subsystem, create or update a module-level README (or docstring) covering:
  - Purpose, responsibilities, and public API
  - Data types and invariants
  - Example usage and integration points
- Add diagrams showing subsystem interactions and event flow.
- Maintain a single source of truth for primitive and plugin definitions.

**Phase 3: Strengthen Plugin and Transformation Registry Cohesion**
- Refactor plugin registration and lifecycle management for uniformity.
- Document plugin API, permissions, and error/result conventions.
- Add validation and tests for plugin interface compliance.

**Phase 4: Clarify and Enforce Boundaries**
- Review all inter-plane and subsystem boundaries for privacy, provenance, and access control.
- Make boundary checks explicit in code and document enforcement points.
- Add boundary enforcement notes to API docs.

**Phase 5: Refactor for Explicit Dependency Injection**
- Refactor constructors to require explicit dependencies (no hidden imports or globals).
- Document required/optional dependencies for each class/module.
- Add dependency diagrams to docs.

**Phase 6: Improve Test Cohesion**
- Organize tests by subsystem and scenario.
- Add integration tests for cross-plane and cross-subsystem flows.
- Document test coverage and scenarios in `tests/README.md`.

---

**Documentation Process:**
- After each phase, update both code docstrings and related Markdown docs.
- Summarize changes and rationale in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
- Capture new patterns or conventions in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.

**Status:**  
Plan committed. Begin with Phase 1: Interface and data flow audit. Update the memory bank after each phase.
