# Active Context

## Foundation

This document builds upon [projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md), [productContext.md](./productContext.md), [systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md), and [techContext.md](./techContext.md).

---

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing the Memory Bank and foundational documentation for GnosisCore.
- Encoding the project's vision, theory, and implementation guidelines.

---

## Recent Changes

- Created projectbrief.md with full project vision and theory.
- Scaffolded productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, and techContext.md.

---

## Next Steps

- Complete scaffolding of Memory Bank with progress.md.
- Begin documenting emergent runtime constructs and their Hermetic mappings.

---

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All documentation and code must reflect provisional, emergent, and dynamic principles.
- Each new module or pattern must explicitly state its Hermetic Principle mapping.
