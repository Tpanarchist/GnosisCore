# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementation and refinement of all three planes (Digital, Mental, Metaphysical) and their subsystems (memory, self-map, transformation, feedback)
- Maintaining thread safety, provenance, and salience mechanisms
- Ensuring plugin-based extensibility and LLM integration
- Keeping test coverage high and aligned with evolving architecture

## Recent Changes
- All core subsystems implemented with Pydantic models and thread-safe registries
- DigitalPlane, MentalPlane, MetaphysicalPlane, and AsyncMetaphysicalPlane fully implemented
- Comprehensive pytest-based test suites for all primitives and subsystems
- README.md updated with architecture, conventions, and standards

## Next Steps
- Expand docs/ with module-level documentation and usage examples
- Integrate more transformation plugins and external APIs
- Continue improving test coverage and CI integration
