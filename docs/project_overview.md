# Project Overview

GnosisCore is a modular, extensible framework for building advanced reasoning, memory, and pattern-based systems. It is designed to support research and development in artificial intelligence, cognitive architectures, and complex data processing.

## Purpose

- Provide a foundation for constructing systems that require persistent memory, pattern recognition, and adaptive flows.
- Enable rapid prototyping and experimentation with new cognitive and reasoning patterns.
- Support integration with large language models (LLMs) and other AI components.

## Core Features

- **Pattern-based architecture:** Modular patterns for memory, awareness, persistence, representation, and more.
- **Extensible flows:** Define and compose flows for data and reasoning processes.
- **LLM integration:** Interfaces for transformer-based models.
- **Persistence:** Mechanisms for storing and retrieving knowledge.
- **Flexible forms:** Support for structured data and form-based processing.
- **Testing support:** Built-in unit tests for core components.

## Target Audience

- AI researchers and developers
- Cognitive science and neuroscience researchers
- Developers building intelligent agents or reasoning systems
